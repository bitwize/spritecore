This is SpriteCore, version 0.75, by Jeffrey T. Read <bitwize@gmail.com>.

It is a 2D game development library written in Objective-C. Features include
an extensible graphical back end architecture (with SDL back end included),
key-color-based sprite blitters, one of which does affine matrix
transformations, and small size.

It is released under the Zlib license.

It is the successor to the Sprite32 library which since its inception until
version 0.6 was written in C++. Remember: C++ is to C as lung cancer is to
lung.

Documentation is in docs/. If you are checking out of the Darcs repository,
then you need to build the docs by doing a "make doc" first (if you want them
locally that is).

Building is as follows:

* edit config.mak
* "make"
* "make install"

Pay special attention to the PLATFORM and RENDERER variables.

"make doc" lets you rebuild the documentation; use it only if you have Apple's
headerdoc toolset installed.

Good luck!
